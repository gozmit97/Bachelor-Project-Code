To install the relevant code, either run "pip3 install qiskit" and "pip3 install pylatexenc" or follow the quide on qiskits page

The first code uploaded Bachelor Project code.ipynb was of an incorrect file where I'd removed a function QFT_inv and a line of code that imported a package from the code, thus breakting the QFT function.

The code Bachelor Project Fixed.ipynb has corrected this error.
