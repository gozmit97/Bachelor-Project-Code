The first code uploaded Bachelor Project code.ipynb was of an incorrect file where I'd removed a function QFT_inv and a line of code that imported a package from the code, thus breaking the QFT function.

The code Bachelor Project Fixed.ipynb has corrected some errors, added a comparisoin of classical and quantum Fourier transform and overall cleaned up the code and notation
